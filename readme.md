# Introduction
This project provides a hands-on comparison of the same stopwatch feature implemented in three different ways. This project is to explore and compare the code to get a feel for each framework's structure, reactivity, and component architecture.

The differences in code complexity, syntax, and performance between the three implementations can give you valuable insights into when and why you might choose one framework over another for your projects.

A stopwatch is a simple feature that can be implemented easily. This project demonstrates how to create a simple stopwatch with features like start, stop, and reset in three different ways:

Vanilla JavaScript: Demonstrates how to build a stopwatch using plain JavaScript.
React: Shows how to create a stopwatch using the React library.
Svelte: Demonstrates the stopwatch implementation using the Svelte framework.


# Implementation Details
**Vanilla JavaScript**
The Vanilla JavaScript implementation can be found in the **vanilla-js** folder. The stopwatch is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any external libraries or frameworks.

**React**
The React implementation is located in the **react** folder. It showcases how to create a stopwatch component using React and demonstrates the component lifecycle.

**Svelte**
The Svelte implementation is in the **svelte** folder. It demonstrates building a stopwatch component using the Svelte framework, which has a different approach to reactive UI updates compared to React.
